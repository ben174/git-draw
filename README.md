# Git Draw
Allows you to draw in your GitHub heatmap

This is a Chrome extension which will allow you to freely draw on your GitHub
heatmap. You can then export your drawing to a script containing a git commit
log. Once you've run and pushed this script to a new repository, your commit
log will match the drawing you made.
