This is a Chrome extension which will allow you to freely draw on your GitHub
heatmap. You can then export your drawing to a script containing a git commit
log. Once you've run and pushed this script to a new repository, your commit
log will match the drawing you made.

Download the extension here:

## Why not a bookmarklet?

Because [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy). GitHub's CSP makes a bookmarklet next to impossible.
There's a workaround involving injecting code into a canvas and then executing
it from there, but that feels like something that'll be fixed. A Chrome extension
makes it easier. Once you're done making your drawing, just uninstall the extension.

GitFiti: https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti - got the idea from here, and 
poked around their src to see how they were writing commit messages.
